# Chat App

Welcome to the Chat App! This is a simple chat application built using React Native and React Navigation. Users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen. Once the user starts chatting, they are navigated to the chat screen with their chosen background color.

## Why a Mobile Chat App?

Traditionally, building high-quality mobile apps required significant time and resources due to the need for specialized programmers for different platforms like iOS and Android. However, advancements in technology such as React Native have simplified this process by enabling developers to build and maintain mobile applications with just one codebase.

This Chat App demonstrates the use of React Native, Expo, and Google Firestore Database to create a native chat app optimized for both Android and iOS devices.
